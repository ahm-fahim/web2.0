        <p>
            What is an API? APIs are mechanisms that enable two software
            components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions
            and protocols. For example, the weather bureau’s software system
            contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks”
            to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your
            phone.
